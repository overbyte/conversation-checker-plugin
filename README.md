Conversation Checker plugin
===========================
This is a plugin for Phonegap for the Publicic Conversation Locker project.

It includes the following functionality:

* add a callable service to check over the phone to make sure of the following:
    * The application isn't switched
    * If the phone goes to sleep, it isn't started up again
    * If a phonecall comes in, it isn't answered
    * If a text comes in, it isn't answered
    * If any of the above, a call back to the server to notify the other phones in the conversation that you just couldn't keep your little hands off
